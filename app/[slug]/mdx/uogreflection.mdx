          university is a mix of highs and lows. some courses are easy, others

            <strong>cis1300 - programming</strong>  
            <div className="text-neutral-600 text-sm">professor: ritu</div>
            easy intro to programming with basic c concepts. assignments were
            straightforward, and the final exam was manageable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>cis1910 - discrete structures i</strong>  
            <div className="text-neutral-600 text-sm">professor: pascal</div>  
            explored logic and proofs. pascal made quizzes and exams online
            before he retired. this course is a brain teaser because it tests
            problem-solving and proof-writing skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>math1160 - linear algebra i</strong>  
            <div className="text-neutral-600 text-sm">professor: garvie</div>  
            best decision was taking it in the fall with garvie. online
            multiple-choice quizzes and exams made it very doable. i was
            supposed to take this in w25, but reddit convinced me to switch.

            <strong>math1200 - calculus i</strong>  
            <div className="text-neutral-600 text-sm">professor: demars</div>  
            barely passed, so i got no comments. calculus was not my thing, but
            the professor was great (he got 5/5 on{" "}

            <strong>mcs1000 - introductory marketing</strong>  
            <div className="text-neutral-600 text-sm">professor: mckenzie</div>  
            super easy elective. simple concepts, and the exams were chill.

        <h3>winter 2024</h3>
        <ul className="space-y-3">

            <div className="text-neutral-600 text-sm">professor: yan yan</div>  
            html, css, and javascript basics. lost marks for spelling, which
            was annoying, but overall an easy course.

          <li>
            <strong>cis2500 - intermediate programming</strong>  
            <div className="text-neutral-600 text-sm">professor: ritu</div>  
            had 98% before my usual exam struggles brought it down. covered
            advanced c topics like pointers and memory management.

            <strong>cis2910 - discrete structures ii</strong>  
            <div className="text-neutral-600 text-sm">professor: colby parsons</div>  
            challenging but fun. colby (a waterloo grad) was interactive and
            even engaged with us on discord.

            worst course i have taken so far. he used lecture slides with tons of
            errors as well as assignments from 23 years ago from a different
            university. ended up dropping it and retaking it in the summer at
            uottawa. avoid this prof at all costs.

            <div className="text-neutral-600 text-sm">professor: zhao zhao</div>  
            easy, but you will be working with old languages like cobol and
            ada. tas took a while to grade, but the marking was pretty light.

            enjoyed it since it involved real-world applications like finding
            the shortest path between cities. feels like cis1910 and cis2910 but
            focused on efficiency.

            some people complain, but i think he is fine. just attend lectures
            and you will be ok. i enjoyed this course because we did not do
            any coding. it is mainly about software development outside of
            coding, so you create figma prototypes and present them to
            volunteers, similar to how it works when you pitch in the real
            world.

          bit of a hectic summer. i am taking a course at both uwaterloo and

          full-time job (full-stack dev) and one part-time job (software dev)
