      i'm about a month into uw cs — here are my thoughts.

      tldr; met many ambitious people that i fw, alot of free time for projects, lectures aren't that bad, coursework isn't as bad as eng (for now at least)

      i move in and did math orientation (was a bunch of bs but worth going to, i was just trolling ☠️ + met one of my closest friends there). classes start and it was hella light at first. i had so much time to network and make projects.
      
      v1 life is really chill, i thought that i got unlucky when i didn't get mkv, uwp, or cmh, but v1 is definitely optimal for cs. its very close to pac & cif and i found that 90% of my cs friends also got assigned here.

      <span className='text-lightBeige/95 font-normal'>when quizzes came around, workload started picking up a little</span>. but it's still better compared to eng. although the assignments & studying defo started taking more time ( i didn't take any of the 14's, and for most of my homies who did dropped within a week or two). side project wise, i worked alot on <span className='text-lightBeige/95 font-normal'><a href="https://phutureai.com" target="_blank" className="a">phuture</a></span> and started making some fun reels
      (nothing better to do in waterloo), i also built <span className='text-lightBeige/95 font-normal'><a href="https://trivialguessr.com" target="_blank" className="a">trivialguessr</a></span> in under a week + went to <span className='text-lightBeige/95 font-normal'>hack the north</span> for the first time.
    </h5>

    <h5 className='text-lighterBeige'>
      side note: friends in eng (especially ce) are telling me that they are like 2 weeks in but 3 weeks behind already 😂.
    </h5>

    <h5>
      <span className='text-lightBeige/95 font-normal'>i definitely missed out on waterloo tech week</span>, i was too into my projects that i didn't consider going to events, but looking back i regret it. 
      
      <span className='text-lightBeige/95 font-normal'>
        go to these events, don't miss out like me.
      </span>

    <h5>
      studying in dc/dp every day has been a weird highlight, something that sounds so mundane creates hella memories. everyone being in the dc basement drinking ice capps + being 'locked in' tryna find each other after the quiz scores get released is actually hilarious ☠️.

      i got friends flying to sf soon and know people who have interest from yc. 3 weeks in, the uw ecosystem is already blossoming. friends are important—<span className='text-lightBeige/95 font-normal'>surround yourself with people who challenge you to dream bigger</span>.
      
      uw cs brings cracked people that you can't meet at your high school together. im enjoying my experience so far.
