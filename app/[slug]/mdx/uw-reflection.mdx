          you might be wondering how i can take courses at the university of
          waterloo as a university of guelph student. the short answer is an lop
          (letter of permission), which lets you take a course elsewhere and
          receive transfer credit back at your home institution. people usually
          do this to make up a failed class or to satisfy a prerequisite that
          was not offered that term at their home university. but for me, i was purely taking it for interest and for fun while transferring a third/fourth year credits which counts towards my degree requirement.

        <h2>summer 2025</h2>
        <p>
        i decided to take <span className='text-lightBeige/95 font-normal'><a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs349/1255" target="_blank" className="a">cs349: user interfaces </a></span> for the summer term. i was going to do cs346: application
        development, but i did not realize it was not offered in summer terms,
        which was unfortunate because i paid $70 for nothing. this course was pretty structured and used modern languages like react, javascript, preact, tailwind ui, canvas ui and more. comparing this to guelph's cis2170: user interface design, guelph does not really focus on those and more theoretical as i heard it from my peers. the course is not too bad as i learnt a lot about

          i attended a bunch of information sessions hosted by employers such as{" "}

          and more. i find them pretty helpful as they had interns talking about their experience, recruiters sharing the process as well as exclusive hiring pool for those who attended the event. i ended up getting an oa from patreon but unfortunately was rejected.

          aside from academics, since i am a uw student,{" "}

          applications opened and i used my uw student id, listed uw as my
          school, and ended up getting accepted. it was clutch since i was able
          to secure a job from there. i also joined uw intramurals 11v11, and we
          made it to the semifinals. we lost, but it was still a great start
          since we were a team of random people.

      , i attended events like the google networking session, where i met some
      impressive people and ran into my cs449 ta (he gave me a 96, which was a
      win). i was a bit nervous going in alone, but once i recognized a few

      and many many more. i realized that winning the hackathon is not really my
      thing, and it is more beneficial for me to attend workshops and interact
      with sponsors since i can make meaningful connections.

      in fall 2025, i ran intramurals again with few people from the summer team. we played 11s and 6s, and did a bit
      worse this time. in 11s we forfeited twice, which knocked us out, and in
      6s we lost in the quarterfinals on pens.

  anyway, back to this term. i ended up taking cs346: application development and cs449: human-computer interaction, where i joined
  teams and started building. cs346 feels like a full stack course, but we are
  doing it for mobile, using kotlin, java, typescript, supabase, and sql. on the
  other side, human-computer interaction (hci) is less about shipping code and
  more about understanding people: framing the problem, building figma
  prototypes, running user interviews, mapping task flows, and doing usability
  tests. it also pushes you to think about accessibility, feedback loops, and
  how small design decisions change user behavior. i finished strong with 92
  and 96, so i am pretty satisfied with the term. unfortunately this might be
  my last one for a bit, since i am unsure when i will be graduating and which
  remaining courses i can take that do not have exams.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>the right events are better than every event</li>
          <li>relationships matter more than hackathon rankings</li>
          <li>hci thinking improves how i build products</li>
          <li>small teams still go far with clear roles</li>
          <li>consistency beats intensity in a busy term</li>
