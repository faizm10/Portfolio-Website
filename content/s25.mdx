### preliminary

after dropping cis3110, i had to retake it over the summer. my options were york, uwaterloo, uottawa, and tmu. i ruled out york pretty quickly — i’d heard the profs weren’t great. i also passed on tmu after hearing they were likely doing a one-test, midterm, and final format. not ideal for me since i usually don’t perform well in exams.

that left me with uwaterloo and uottawa.

at first, i was fine with uwaterloo. but after digging into the course structure at uottawa, it seemed like the better fit:

> zybook, midterm, final, and assignments

zybook is basically free marks, and i usually do well on assignments. that meant i’d only need to manage the midterm and final — plus, there’s no pass/fail component tied to any of them. the only downside? uottawa is far. like, 5–6 hours by train or bus one way. i don’t mind commuting, but doing that weekly would’ve been a lot — in time and money.

so i registered for uwaterloo first, just to get a feel for things while waiting for uottawa’s non-degree enrollment to open. eventually, i got into both uwaterloo and uottawa for operating systems.

then i noticed uwaterloo’s cs349 (user interfaces) had recently been revamped. it looked solid — typescript, vite, dom, and modern ui concepts. since it’s a third-year course, i’d be able to transfer it toward my uoguelph electives. so i went for it.

after registering for those two, i added four 6-week courses and one 12-week course at uog to round out the rest of my credits. i figured if i pushed through the short ones early, the second half of the summer would be more manageable.

so yeah — heading into summer 2025, i signed up for **8 courses across 3 universities**, while juggling 2 jobs — one as a full stack developer at uog, and the other as a software dev intern at brown & beatty.

definitely one of my most ambitious summers yet.

### week 1–3

week one hit hard. here’s what my schedule looked like (my full-time job hadn’t started yet):

- **monday**: cs349 @ uwaterloo  
- **tuesday**: commute to ottawa  
  (pulled an all-nighter, left the house at 4am, took the megabus with a layover in kingston, arrived in ottawa around 12:30pm)  
- **wednesday**: cs349 again  
- **thursday**: cs350 @ uwaterloo  
- **friday**: back to ottawa  
  (another sleepless night, same early morning departure, same long bus ride)

i survived the first week. no biggie.

week 2 rolled in, and i officially started my full stack dev role at uog.

met a few people, had brunch with the team, and got introduced to the three projects i’d be working on over the summer. i was also attending the uottawa lectures via zoom since the prof offered hybrid access — which was a huge help. in between that, i was slowly chipping away at my brown & beatty tasks too.

it was a lot — but somehow, it felt like things were starting to click.

writing this at 2:04 AM on a saturday june 28th. finished with 4 guelph courses and had my midterm for cs349 @ uwaterloo. things are now cooling down after 2 hectic months. juggling between guelph online courses, in person midterm at ottawa, doing user interface at uwaterloo and on top of all these courses, i am doing intramurals at uwaterloo and missisuaga stadium. i also registered my courses for fall and winter and feels a little unreal that i could possibly graduate in winter 2026 (i am still thinking if i want to do it)
