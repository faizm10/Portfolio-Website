### preliminary

after dropping cis3110, i had to retake it over the summer. my options were york, uwaterloo, uottawa, and tmu. i ruled out york pretty quickly — i’d heard the profs weren’t great. i also passed on tmu after hearing they were likely doing a one-test, midterm, and final format. not ideal for me since i usually don’t perform well in exams.

that left me with uwaterloo and uottawa.

at first, i was fine with uwaterloo. but after digging into the course structure at uottawa, it seemed like the better fit:

> zybook, midterm, final, and assignments

zybook is basically free marks, and i usually do well on assignments. that meant i’d only need to manage the midterm and final — plus, there’s no pass/fail component tied to any of them. the only downside? uottawa is far. like, 5–6 hours by train or bus one way. i don’t mind commuting, but doing that weekly would’ve been a lot — in time and money.

so i registered for uwaterloo first, just to get a feel for things while waiting for uottawa’s non-degree enrollment to open. eventually, i got into both uwaterloo and uottawa for operating systems.

then i noticed uwaterloo’s cs349 (user interfaces) had recently been revamped. it looked solid — typescript, vite, dom, and modern ui concepts. since it’s a third-year course, i’d be able to transfer it toward my uoguelph electives. so i went for it.

after registering for those two, i added four 6-week courses and one 12-week course at uog to round out the rest of my credits. i figured if i pushed through the short ones early, the second half of the summer would be more manageable.

so yeah — heading into summer 2025, i signed up for **8 courses across 3 universities**, while juggling 2 jobs — one as a full stack developer at uog, and the other as a software dev intern at brown & beatty.

definitely one of my most ambitious summers yet.

### week 1–3

week one hit hard. here’s what my schedule looked like (my full-time job hadn’t started yet):

- **monday**: cs349 @ uwaterloo  
- **tuesday**: commute to ottawa  
  (pulled an all-nighter, left the house at 4am, took the megabus with a layover in kingston, arrived in ottawa around 12:30pm)  
- **wednesday**: cs349 again  
- **thursday**: cs350 @ uwaterloo  
- **friday**: back to ottawa  
  (another sleepless night, same early morning departure, same long bus ride)

i survived the first week. no biggie.

week 2 rolled in, and i officially started my full stack dev role at uog.

met a few people, had brunch with the team, and got introduced to the three projects i’d be working on over the summer. i was also attending the uottawa lectures via zoom since the prof offered hybrid access — which was a huge help. in between that, i was slowly chipping away at my brown & beatty tasks too.

it was a lot — but somehow, it felt like things were starting to click.

### week 4–8

as things picked up, i started getting into a groove. the chaos of the first few weeks mellowed into something that felt… manageable.

by week 6, i had wrapped up most of my 6-week courses at guelph. felt good to check those off early. with only one 12-week course left at uog, the workload dropped just enough to focus more on my other commitments.

on the dev side, my role at **brown & beatty** started to get more involved. initially, i was focused on frontend work — building out interfaces using next.js, typescript, and tailwind — but eventually, i dove into database integration too. a lot of the features were tied to internal dashboards and file management workflows, so i spent a good chunk of time syncing with the team and cleaning up the data flow across the app.

over at **uoguelph**, i was juggling two projects as part of my full stack role. one was for the *Lang School*, managing award applications — think: student forms, reviewer dashboards, automated status changes, etc. the other was tied to *Dress To Impress*, where we built a platform to manage clothing rentals for students prepping for interviews or presentations. it was cool to see how tech could directly support students’ real-life needs.

outside of school and work, i still kept myself busy by being part of couple of hackathons and getting myself physically active

i mentored at **Hack404**, helping new hackers with ideation and debugging their projects. it felt nice to give back, especially since i’ve been on the hacker side so many times. not long after, i competed at **SpurHacks** where my team built *Dialzara*, an AI front desk that could handle bookings, FAQs, and customer calls using GPT-4o and Twilio. the hackathon was kinda rigged but W project

sports-wise, i was staying active too. played intramurals at **uwaterloo** and **mississauga** when i was back home.

### last few weeks of summer

the final stretch was a blur. i had my exam at uottawa lined up around the same time as terrahacks, so i basically lived out of a backpack that weekend. stayed at the hackathon until like 6 am on sunday, dipped straight to the bus station at 7, rode it all the way to ottawa until 1 pm, and then went straight into my exam at 2. not the smartest schedule, but hey — i survived.

after that, i had about two weeks to grind for the uwaterloo exam. pulled long study sessions, brushed up on all the dom + simplekit stuff, and went into the test hoping for the best. finished late — around 10 pm on a tuesday — and walked out feeling like a huge weight was finally off my shoulders.

a week later, i found out i actually did better than i thought. i passed the course — W.

on the work side, i wrapped up my URA contract but got an extension for one of the projects, which was nice. same thing with brown & beatty — they extended me too, but this time with a bump in pay. not a bad way to end a summer that started off completely chaotic.
