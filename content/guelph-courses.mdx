# **My Guelph CS Journey**

## **First Year**

### **Fall 2023**

- **CIS1300 - Programming**  
  **Professor:** Ritu  
  ```c
  printf("easy intro to programming with basic C concept");
  printf("Assignments were straightforward");
  printf("and the final exam was manageable")
  ```

- **CIS1910 - Discrete Structures I**  
  **Professor:** Pascal  
  - explored the logic and proofs and Pascal made quizzes and exams online before he retired. this course can be a brain teaser since it tests your ability to problem solve and prove statements

- **MATH1160 - Linear Algebra I**  
  **Professor:** Garvie  
  - Best decision to take it in the fall with Garvie. Multiple-choice quizzes and exams, all online, made it very doable. supposed to take this in W25 but saw on Reddit that take this course with Garvie if you are able to. 

- **MATH1200 - Calculus I**  
  **Professor:** Demars 
  - barely passed this course so i got no comments on this. calculus wasn’t my thing, but on a side note, the professor was very good (he got 5/5 on [ratemyprof](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/1404136))

- **MCS1000 - Introductory Marketing**  
  **Professor:** McKenzie 
  - Bird elective. Simple concepts, exams were chill.

### **Winter 2024**

- **CIS1050 - Web Design & Development**  
  **Professor:** Yan Yan
    - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics. Got marks off for spelling, which was unfortunate. overall, it was an easy course.

- **CIS2500 - Intermediate Programming**  
  **Professor:** Ritu 
    - had *98%* before a big drop on grade due to my historical exam struggles. explored advanced C topics such as pointers, memory management, etc

- **CIS2910 - Discrete Structures II**  
  **Professor:** Colby Parsons  
    - Challenging but enjoyable. Colby, a Waterloo grad, was interactive and even engaged with us on Discord.

### **Summer 2024**

All bird courses while doing [URA](https://faizm.vercel.app/blog/ura-journey) at the same time.
- **FRHD1010 - Human Development**
- **MCS2100 - Personal Financial Management**
- **MGMT2150 - Intro to Canadian Business**
- **NUTR1010 - Introduction to Nutrition**

## **Second Year**
### **Fall 2024**

- **CIS2030 - Microcomputers**  
  **Professor:** Gary Grewel 
  toughest course so far. Low-level programming and assembly were rough. Somehow passed even though I failed the exam.

- **CIS2430 - Object-Oriented Programming**  
  **Professor:** Fei Song  
  Had background in Java from high school, which helped. Super enjoyable.

- **CIS2520 - Data Structures (84%)**  
  **Professor:** Yan Yan  
  One of my favorites. concepts just clicked in for me and enjoyed the contents. even made a [github repo](https://github.com/faizm10/cis2520-exam-review), with over 200+ views, to help people study for the final exam

- **FRHD1100 - Life: Health and Well-Being (85%)**  
  **Professor:** Susan Chang
  bird course. Came in clutch for the final to save my gpa this semester

### **Winter 2025 (current)**
- **CIS2750 - Software Development & Integration**  
  **Professor:** Dennis Nikitenko 
  Used to be a really hard course with high fail rate, but it’s been made more lenient. Likely project-heavy.

- **CIS3110 - Operating Systems**  
  **Professor:** Andrew Hamilton-Wright  
  Worst course I’ve taken so far. i've dropped it and will take it again in the summer at either University of Waterloo or University of Ottawa. Avoid with this prof at all costs. 
  - [RateMyProf](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2707345)
  - [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/uoguelph/comments/1indyyi/cis3110_prof_receives_30_10_reviews_in_3_hours/)

- **CIS3190 - Software for Legacy Systems**  
  **Professor:** Zhao Zhao
  - bird course, but you’ll be working with an old, old, old language like Cobal and Ada

- **CIS3490 - Algorithm Design & Analysis**  
  **Professors:** Joe Sawada & Daniel Garbic  
  - it is enjoyable so far. Similar to CIS1910 and CIS2910 but more focused on algorithm efficiency.

- **CIS3750 - System Analysis & Design**  
  **Professor:** Daniel Gillis  
  - heard people complain about him, but I think he’s fine. Just attend lectures and you'll be okay.
