> university is a mix of highs and lows. some courses are easy, others will test your patience. here's my honest breakdown of my cs journey at guelph.

## **first year**  

### **fall 2023**  

- **cis1300 - programming**  
  **professor:** ritu  
  ```c
  printf("easy intro to programming with basic c concept");
  printf("assignments were straightforward");
  printf("and the final exam was manageable");
  ```

- **cis1910 - discrete structures I**  
  **professor:** pascal  
  - explored logic and proofs. pascal made quizzes and exams online before he retired. this course is a brain teaser since it tests problem-solving and proof-writing skills.  

- **MATH1160 - linear algebra I**  
  **professor:** garvie  
  - best decision to take it in the fall with garvie. online multiple-choice quizzes and exams made it very doable. supposed to take this in w25 but saw on reddit that taking it with garvie is a smart move.  

- **MATH1200 - calculus I**  
  **professor:** demars  
  - barely passed, so i got no comments. calculus wasn’t my thing, but the professor was great (he got 5/5 on [ratemyprof](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/1404136)).  

- **MCS1000 - introductory marketing**  
  **professor:** mckenzie  
  - super easy elective. simple concepts, and the exams were chill.  

### **winter 2024**  

- **cis1050 - web design & development**  
  **professor:** yan yan  
  - html, css, and javascript basics. lost marks for spelling, which was annoying, but overall, an easy course.  

- **cis2500 - intermediate programming**  
  **professor:** ritu  
  - had *98%* before my usual exam struggles brought it down. covered advanced c topics like pointers and memory management.  

- **cis2910 - discrete structures ii**  
  **professor:** colby parsons  
  - challenging but fun. colby (a waterloo grad) was interactive and even engaged with us on discord.  

### **summer 2024**  

all bird courses while doing [ura](https://faizm.vercel.app/blog/ura-journey).  

- **FRHD1010 - human development**  
  - **professor:** susan change
- **MCS2100 - personal financial management**    
  - **professor:** leslie legge
- **MGMT2150 - intro to canadian business**    
  - **professor:** mir lotfi
- **NUTR1010 - introduction to nutrition**

## **second year**  

### **fall 2024**  

- **cis2030 - microcomputers**  
  **professor:** gary grewel  
  - toughest course so far. low-level programming and assembly were rough. somehow passed, even though i failed the exam.  

- **cis2430 - object-oriented programming**  
  **professor:** fei song  
  - had java experience from high school, which helped a lot. really enjoyed this course.  

- **cis2520 - data structures**  
  **professor:** yan yan  
  - one of my favorites. the concepts just clicked for me. even made a [github repo](https://github.com/faizm10/cis2520-exam-review) (200+ views) to help others study for the final.  

- **FRHD1100 - life: health and well-being**  
  **professor:** robin milhausen
  - bird course. clutched my gpa with this one.  

### **winter 2025 (current)**  

- **cis2750 - software development & integration**  
  **professor:** dennis nikitenko  
  - used to be a really tough course with a high fail rate, but it’s easier now. likely project-heavy.  

- **cis3110 - operating systems**  
  **professor:** andrew hamilton-wright  
  - worst course i’ve taken. dropped it and will retake it in the summer at either uWaterloo or uOttawa. avoid this prof at all costs.  
    - [ratemyprof](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2707345)  
    - [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/uoguelph/comments/1indyyi/cis3110_prof_receives_30_10_reviews_in_3_hours/)  

- **cis3190 - software for legacy systems**  
  **professor:** zhao zhao  
  - easy, but you’ll be working with old languages like cobol and ada.  

- **cis3490 - algorithm design & analysis**  
  **professors:** joe sawada & daniel garbic  
  - enjoying it so far. feels like cis1910 and cis2910 but focused on efficiency.  

- **cis3750 - system analysis & design**  
  **professor:** daniel gillis  
  - some people complain, but i think he’s fine. just attend lectures, and you’ll be okay.
