# overview

pretty awesome overall. attending workshops, talking to different sponsors and learning more about what they do, how to get noticed and of course, the freebies. i had an onsite interview with TD Bank for Software Engineer for Winter 2026 and ended up getting the job. this is the first time i got an interview since i started applying for jobs and finally got one because Hack The North made it happen. 

# sponsors

insane lineup including:
- Amazon (bunch of stickers and some goodies + onsite interviews)
- YCombinator (Hack The North x YCombinator sweater)
- Tech@RBC 
- Citadel (T-Shirts)
- Shopify (T-Shirts)
- Intact
- Intuit
- Uber
- TD Bank (onsite interviews)
- Coinbase
- Jane Street
- Windsurf
- Databricks

Some sponsors actually had private job listenings only for the Hack The North attendees which is pretty awesome. (I secured interview with TD Bank!)
