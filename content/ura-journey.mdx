## **my ura journey & summer 2024 job hunt**  

> job hunting is a grind. you apply, wait, and sometimes never hear back. but every step is a lesson.  

### **summer 2024 job hunt**  

i applied to **41 URA positions** and **51 summer 2024 intern/co-op roles**. response rate? **brutal.**  

- **URA applications:** 41  
  - **1st interviews:** 11  
  - **no response:** 29  
  - **offers:** 1 (accepted)  

- **intern/co-op applications:** 51  
  - **1st interviews:** 1 (**metrolinx**)  
  - **rejected:** 10  
  - **no response:** 40  

- **1st interviews total:** 6 rejected, 4 ghosted, 1 offer (accepted)  

at one point, i had **two offers** but had to reject one. ended up accepting a **URA role in the department of marketing and consumer studies**.  

### **ura interviews**  

i explored a **wide range of research topics**, from **machine learning in finance** to **barley genetics** and **hydrology data portals**. some were directly related to my interests, others involved very little cs work like doing R, data cleaning, and doing some office related work.

#### **URA roles i interviewed for:**  

1. **modelling animal performance & environmental impact** (animal biosciences)  
2. **sports & social media research projects** (management)  
3. **undergrad experiences in STEM** (interactive biology)  
4. **forecasting financial risk w/ machine learning** (economics)  
5. **curriculum development & academic quality assurance** (office of quality assurance)  
6. **ultrasonographic & chemical composition of organs** (biomedical sciences)  
7. **barley genetic variation & chromosomal basis** (plant agriculture)  
8. **sport business & marketing research** (management)  
9. **the economic value of tacit knowledge** (marketing & consumer studies) â†’ **(accepted offer)**  
10. **open global hydrology data portal** (engineering)  
11. **website research coordinator** (college of arts)  

#### **the weird offer i didnâ€™t take**  

got an **offer for an app predicting solid fat content in triglycerides**â€¦ without an interview. felt **random and kinda weird**, so i just left it. if i wasnâ€™t even asked a single question, how did they decide i was the right fit?  

### **why i accepted my ura offer**  

to be honest, it was the only thing i had on my plate so i accepted the offer without any second thoughts. jus wanted to get a job this summer. i ended up developing an [ai chatbot](https://mcs-2020.vercel.app/) for mcs2020 de course and did some research on ethics of it

### **metrolinx interview**  

i also got an **interview with metrolinx** for a **summer intern role**. didnâ€™t work out, but it was still a solid experience.  

### **biggest takeaways from this journey**  

- apply **everywhere**â€”you never know what will stick.  
- rejection is normal. getting ghosted is even more normal.  
- some offers will come **without an interview** (weird, but it happens).  
- sometimes, the best opportunity isnâ€™t the one you expected.  

this journey wasnâ€™t easy, but it got me a solid research position and some valuable experience along the way. on to the next challenge. ðŸš€
