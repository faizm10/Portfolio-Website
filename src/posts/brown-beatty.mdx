_When Brown & Beatty reached out about a contract position, I wasn't sure what to expect._&nbsp; They were a well-established company with decades of history, but their digital infrastructure needed modernization. The opportunity to help transform their web presence was exactly the kind of challenge I was looking for.

Anyway, let me take you behind the scenes of _my contract work at Brown & Beatty - modernizing legacy systems and building new web solutions from the ground up._&nbsp;

### The Challenge

Brown & Beatty had been operating successfully for years, but their web presence was built on outdated technology. They needed someone who could bridge the gap between their existing systems and modern web development practices. The goal wasn't just to build new features—it was to create a foundation that would serve them for years to come.

I came in with a clear mission: **modernize their frontend**, **improve user experience**, and **set up processes** that would make future development easier. This wasn't just about writing code—it was about understanding their business needs and translating them into technical solutions.

### The Tech Stack

Building **modern web solutions** for a traditional company required careful consideration. I needed to choose technologies that were both cutting-edge and maintainable, ensuring that future developers could easily pick up where I left off.

I used a **pragmatic tech stack** focused on reliability and developer experience:

Frontend Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) <br/>
Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) <br/>
UI Components: [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) <br/>
Type Safety: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) <br/>
State Management: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs) <br/>
API Integration: [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query) <br/>
Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) <br/>

### Building Solutions

The work varied from day to day. Some weeks I was building new features from scratch, other weeks I was refactoring legacy code to make it more maintainable. The key was always understanding the business context—why a feature existed, who used it, and how it fit into their larger workflow.

One of my favorite projects was rebuilding their client portal. The old version was functional but clunky, with a confusing navigation and outdated design. I redesigned it from the ground up, focusing on clarity and ease of use. The result? A 40% reduction in support tickets related to portal navigation.

### Working as a Contractor

Contract work is different from full-time employment. You need to be more self-directed, communicate clearly about timelines and expectations, and deliver value quickly. But it also gives you the freedom to focus on what you do best—building great software.

I've learned to balance speed with quality, knowing when to move fast and when to slow down and do things right. Every decision I make needs to consider not just the immediate need, but how it will impact the codebase long-term.

### What I Learned

> The best code is code that solves real problems for real people, not code that looks impressive in isolation.

To be honest, I learned a lot working at Brown & Beatty. I gained a deeper **understanding of business requirements** and **legacy system integration**, as well as how to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. But more importantly, I learned that great software comes from truly understanding the problem you're solving.

When I started, I was focused on writing perfect code. But over time, I realized that the best solutions are the ones that make people's lives easier, even if the code isn't the most elegant. You don't need to be perfect to deliver value, you just need to understand what matters most.

This contract has been an incredible learning experience, and I'm looking forward to continuing to help Brown & Beatty modernize their digital presence. If there's one takeaway, it's that the best developers are the ones who can translate business needs into technical solutions that actually work.
