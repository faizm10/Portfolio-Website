_When I first applied to be a teaching assistant, I thought it would be straightforward._&nbsp; Help students with assignments, grade some code, answer questions. Simple, right? What I didn't expect was how much I would learn about teaching, learning, and the importance of clear communication.

Anyway, let me take you behind the scenes of _my experience as a teaching assistant at the University of Guelph - helping students learn computer science while learning a lot myself._&nbsp;

### Getting Started

I started as a TA for MCS*2020 (Introduction to Programming) in September 2024, then moved to MCS*2000 (Data Structures and Algorithms) in September 2025. Both courses were foundational, which meant students were often seeing these concepts for the first time. That made the role both challenging and rewarding.

The first thing I learned? **Explaining something you understand deeply to someone who doesn't is harder than it looks.** What seems obvious to you might be completely foreign to someone else. I had to learn to break down complex concepts into smaller, digestible pieces.

### The Day-to-Day

A typical week involved office hours, lab sessions, grading assignments, and preparing for tutorials. Office hours were my favorite part—students would come in with questions, and I'd help them work through problems. Sometimes it was a simple syntax error. Other times, it was a fundamental misunderstanding that required a complete explanation from scratch.

Lab sessions were where I really saw students grow. Watching someone struggle with a concept for an hour, then suddenly have that "aha!" moment? That never gets old. It's why I kept coming back semester after semester.

### Grading and Feedback

Grading assignments taught me a lot about code quality and communication. I wasn't just looking for correct solutions—I was looking for code that was readable, well-structured, and properly documented. More importantly, I learned to give feedback that was constructive, not just critical.

The best feedback I could give wasn't "this is wrong," but "here's why this doesn't work, and here's how to think about it differently." That approach helped students learn from their mistakes instead of just feeling discouraged.

### Common Challenges

Students struggled with different things. Some had trouble with syntax. Others understood the concepts but couldn't translate them into code. A few were completely new to programming and needed extra support. The key was recognizing where each student was and meeting them there.

I developed a toolkit of explanations, analogies, and examples that I could pull from depending on the student's learning style. Some needed visual diagrams. Others needed step-by-step walkthroughs. A few just needed someone to listen while they talked through the problem out loud.

### What I Learned

> Teaching isn't about showing how smart you are—it's about helping someone else understand something they didn't before.

To be honest, I learned a lot being a TA. I gained a deeper **understanding of computer science fundamentals** by having to explain them clearly, as well as **patience** and **communication skills** that I use in every aspect of my work. But more importantly, I learned that the best teachers are the ones who remember what it's like to not understand.

When I started, I thought being a good TA meant knowing all the answers. But over time, I realized that sometimes the best thing you can do is say "I don't know, but let's figure it out together." You don't need to be perfect to help someone learn, you just need to be willing to meet them where they are.

This experience has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm grateful for every student who taught me something about teaching. If there's one takeaway, it's that the best way to truly understand something is to try to explain it to someone else.
