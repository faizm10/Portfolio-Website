    "I'm a dual student at the **University of Guelph** and **University of Waterloo**, where I focus on **system design**, **AI**, and building **full-stack products** that people actually use. I'm driven by the challenge of turning ideas into real toolsâ€”whether it's for students, startups, or research. Outside of tech, I enjoy photography, playing competitive sports, and building new ideas with friends at hackathons.",
