In Winter 2024, I locked in on landing a URA role and spent every spare moment hunting down openings. I customized dozens of cover letters, tweaked my résumé for each project description, and hit “submit” on 41 applications—all while juggling classes, intramurals, and late-night study sessions. I checked my inbox obsessively, hopeful that a single interview invite would validate all those hours of prep. It wasn’t just about the job; it was about proving to myself that I could cut through the noise and find my place in research.  

## My URA journey & summer 2024 job hunt

> Applying felt like running uphill: slow, exhausting—and often ending with nothing but more uphill to climb.

### The stats  
- **41 URA applications**  
  - 11 first-round calls  
  - 29 crickets  
  - 1 offer (which I happily accepted)

- **51 intern/co-op applications**  
  - 1 interview (Metrolinx)  
  - 10 polite “no thanks”  
  - 40 radio silence

In total: 12 conversations, 6 rejections, 4 ghostings, and 1 golden ticket.

### The offer I skipped  
One afternoon, an unexpected email popped up: an offer to predict solid-fat content in triglycerides—with zero interview. If I can’t even spell “triglyceride” without Googling it, how did they think I’d measure it? I passed.

### Why I accepted the marketing & consumer studies URA  
It wasn’t flashy, but it was real work. I built an [AI chatbot for the MCS2020 DE course](https://mcs-2020.vercel.app/), ran literature reviews on ethics, and sat in on meetings that shaped our department’s research questions. Hands-on experience—and a steady paycheck—won me over.

### My Metrolinx detour  
Getting that Metrolinx interview felt like a milestone—my very first one. It was for a general student role, so I didn’t expect it and barely prepared. Considering it was an online interview, I had to adapt to the virtual format on the fly. I logged in, tackled their questions in real time, and even without an offer, I walked away with a boost in confidence and a sharper sense of how to share my story under pressure.  

## Key takeaways  
1. **Cast a wide net.** You never know which application will land.  
2. **Rejection is part of the deal.** Ghosting stings, but it’s not personal.  
3. **Follow your gut.** If a role feels off, trust your instincts.  
4. **Unexpected paths teach the most.** The detours often lead to growth.

That summer tested my persistence and patience—and rewarded me with a research role, new skills, and proof that I belong in tech. Onward to the next challenge! 🚀
